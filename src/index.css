/*

  @layer components {
    This directive is used to define a specific layer for your CSS rules. 
    Layers help in organizing and managing the CSS code by grouping related styles together. 
    In this case, the styles within the @layer components block are part of the 'components' layer.
  }

  .container {
    @apply mx-auto px-4;
    The @apply directive is used to include a set of utility classes from a CSS framework (like Tailwind CSS) 
    into a single class. Here, 'mx-auto' centers the container horizontally, and 'px-4' adds horizontal padding.
    max-width: 1200px;
    This sets the maximum width of the container to 1200 pixels.
  }
